# Evar

Evar is a group project for the COSC 4351 - Software Engineering, Spring 2015, class at the University of Houston. Evar is implemented using C#, ASP.NET for the front-end and Microsoft SQL Server for the database. 

## Description

The Online International Evar System is a web site with large scale database of EVAR (EndoVascular Aortic Aneurysm Repair) data. The system allows uploading patient preoperative and postoperative long term follow-up EVAR data to the large scale database. For the EVAR data quantitative image and flow analysis results can be stored back in the database allowing a surgeon to review these results and to retrieve comparison reports for best decision making.
